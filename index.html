            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is very helpful when you are working on a file, and you wish to make a change. You make that change, but later on, you don't like it and want to go back to a pervious version. Version Control allows you to go back to that previous version, and any version from before that. I personally think, while many files can add up, it is a great way to keep everything organized and even help fix bugs that appear. This is releveant because we will be using GIT, a VCS, to help us with Version Control.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">VCS</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VCS stands for Version Control system. It is essentially a system that helps users with their version control. It can automatically note who changes files, when they were changed, what's new about the file, and even maerge changes into one single file. This is great for multiple people trying to update the same file. Instead of everyone making the same changes to each file, they can all upload their version of the changed file, and the VCS will merge them into one file. I have no experience with this yet, but this is some space age stuff to me, it's amazing, and I'm sure it will be helpful for this class.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Repositories sort of work like a file bank that you or multiple people can access. There are two kinds of repositories: Remote and Local. A Remote Repository is a repository that resides on a remote server that multiple team members can access. A Local Repository is a repository that is accessed by the user on their local machine.Cloud9 is a local repository and GitHUB is a remote repository. Since both of these are essential to this class, knowing whhat a repository is will help keep things from getting to overwhelming and complicated.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT or GitHUB is the remote repository we will be using for this class, and is also starting to widely appear among many other companies in need of a solid VCS. SOme benefits of GIT is that it is fast, everything is local, and each user has their own copy of the repository on their local machine. At the time of this assignment, GIT is a little confusing to use, however the commands to add, commit, and push are simple enough.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">File Editing</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This class is all about file editing. Pretty much everything involving application design is file editing. it is important, and ometimes many people will work on the same file. Shown before, a VCS is very good at allowing this to happen without multiple people messing up the file in some way with confilcting code. And if the file does break, theres a previous version to work from.</p>
